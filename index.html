				<div class="cn-content" id="about-content">
					<p>When you bring your pet to my house it is the equivalent of going to Grandma's house. In my case "Nanny Cindy's". I believe in lots of love, petting, scratching, snuggling and most importantly, walks for lots of sniffing and exercise. My home overlooks the Barton Creek so we have beautiful views and exceptional routes for walking.</p>
					<p>Here is my schedule. We get up and have an early morning walk. If your dog is old it may be only to the end of the block. If your dog is young and raring to go I can walk them up to 20-30 minutes depending on heat index. We come back and have breakfast, then I work in my upholstery shop which is attached to the kitchen. My doggy guest usually hang out in the den/ kitchen and enjoy watching me work while they lounge. LOL Since I work from home there is always time for lots of potty breaks and sniffing. When the weather is nice I keep the sliding glass door partially open so dogs can freely roam inside and out. Lunchtime we play in the back yard. Dinner is at 5 then a short walk depending on heat index.</p>
